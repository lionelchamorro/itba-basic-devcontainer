# ITBA - ML Devcontainer

## Technology Stack
- **Development Containers**: Streamlined development with [DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:lionelchamorro/itba-basic-devcontainer.git
   ```

2. Install the lastest version of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).


### VS Code development environment
1. Install the [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the project in VS Code.
3. Click on the green button in the bottom left corner of the VS Code window and select the `Reopen in Container` option. Alternatively, you can run the `Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).
4. VS Code will automatically build the Docker images and start the containers. This may take a few minutes. Once the containers are up and running, you can start developing in the VS Code development environment.
